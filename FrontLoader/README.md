NES-I/O 1.5
===========


This is the FrontLoader folder.

The Classic SNES Multiout requires the following PCBs (gerber zipped files):
- NES_IO_US_REV1.5_SNES
- Audio_Blank

The NOCUT requires the following PCBs (gerber zipped files):
- NES_IO_US_REV1.5_NOCUT
- miniDIN4_spacer
- Audio_Blank



-- You need to send to fab the blank audio module PCB for all versions, and the miniDIN 4 spacer IN 1MM THICK for the NOCUT.
--
-- You'll need to cut some parts on the PCBs: they are currently designed to avoid extra costs on castelated vias.
--
-- They are around the RCA plugs and on the miniDIN4_spacer.
